## Please change your config. I'll have a list of good configurations, but I suggest human-like or realistic ones. You should NOT use perfect & fast-paced. Unaware at this time whether it works on quizzes, but please have academic integrity. This is an open-source project (the custom configurations and modifications) that I would hate to have to take down due to my school's policies. DO NOT USE AT SCHOOL. USE IN CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS
